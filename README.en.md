## What is GitSite?
GitSite is an affordable web hosting platform that stands out for its **very low prices**. Designed to help people who don't know how to host a site, GitSite offers a **simple and effective** solution to get **your website** online easily.

By using GitSite, you can host your site directly on a custom subdomain, such as **gitsite.dev/your-name**, giving you a **professional web address** that's easy to remember.

In addition to its affordability, GitSite **guarantees quality service** and a 24/7 online site. Whether you want to host a personal blog, a portfolio, or a site for your small business, GitSite offers several plans with **different perks**.


## How to Host My Site?

### 1. Create a Fork of the Repository
- Access the GitSite GitHub repository here: [20syldev/gitsite](https://github.com/20syldev/gitsite).
- Fork the repository: Click on the "**Fork**" button at the top right of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### 2. Modify Your Files
- If your subscription allows you to store your site on the URL gitsite.dev/your-name:
  - Add or modify your files: Click on "**Add File**" in the [base branch](https://github.com/20syldev/gitsite/tree/main), then you will have two options:
    - Either "**Create a new file**" to start writing a file from scratch (or paste your own code).
    - Or "**Upload files**" to directly add your file(s) or folder(s) from your device.
  - Then move on to the next step.

- Otherwise, if your subscription allows you to store your site on the URL gitsite.dev/u/your-name:
  - Add or modify your files: Click on "**Add File**" while on the [folder page](https://github.com/20syldev/gitsite/tree/main/u) /u/, then you will have two options:
    - Either "**Create a new file**" to start writing a file from scratch (or paste your own code).
    - Or "**Upload files**" to directly add your file(s) or folder(s) from your device.
  - Then move on to the next step.

### 3. Push the Changes and Create a Pull Request
- Send the changes to your Fork: click on "**Commit changes...**"
- Create a pull request:
  - Go to the page of your forked repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).
  - Click on the "**Compare & pull request**" button.
  - Make sure the base branch is **20syldev/gitsite** and the compare branch is the one where you made your changes.
  - Add a title and description to your pull request, then click on "**Create pull request**".

### 4. Review and Acceptance of the Pull Request
As the owners of the original repository, we will receive a **notification** of the pull request, and we will start the **review**.  
With the proposed changes, if there is an issue, we may **comment**, request **further modifications**, or **approve** the pull request.

### Validation Conditions
To ensure a pull request is accepted, you must:
- Have respected the **waiting period** between two modification submissions.
- Verify that you have the right to **add scripts** with your subscription.
- Ensure you have **not modified anything** other than your site's code or files.
- Be sure you have completed your changes for the next few days to **avoid repetitive requests**.
